Oh man, just finished watching The King of Kings. You know, the old one from '27? Crazy stuff. Like, seriously, the silent film era was something else. It's wild how they told stories without any words. I'm still kinda wrapping my head around it. There was soooo much eye acting. 😂

I mean, it's almost like you gotta trust those big dramatic gestures 'cause there's no dialogue to back it up. And the cinematography? Dude, some of the shots were just...wow. It's like they got no limits, you know? Anyway, it was kinda exhausting to keep up with everything happening on screen — or maybe I'm just tired. 😴

You gotta wonder about those actors back then, really being all extra with their expressions. It's like they had to compensate for the lack of sound with all the bravado. Ah, the drama. But it works, kinda charms you in a way. I dunno, maybe that's just me.

>At first, I couldn't find it anywhere, so I thought I’d have to download the movie, but then I realized I could just stream it. Classic me, always overcomplicating it! 🤦‍♂️ The things I do try to relive history, huh?

Did you ever think about how much patience people had back in the day? Like, they’d sit through this super long movie with no dialogue, no fancy effects, just raw storytelling. Imagine trying to pull that off now, people would lose it like 15 minutes in. Or at least I would, lol.

Okay, random tangent: there was this one scene where I was like...wow, it just hits you out of nowhere. That’s art, I guess? Like, capturing something so raw. Even in black and white, it just pops, you know what I mean? Are we ever gonna have something like that in movies today? Hmm. 🤔

Console.WriteLine(Why did I even type this?);

Anyway, I guess it's cool to watch the movie now, get a feel for how far we've come. The emotions, man, they don't make 'em like they used to. But yeah, thanks for sticking around for my TED Talk on a 1927 film. 😂 Lemme know if you check it out, we can laugh-cry about the acting together. 🤷‍♂️
